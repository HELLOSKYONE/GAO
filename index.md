### Key Points to Check:

1. **`_config.yml`**: Ensure it is correctly configured (which you have already done).
2. **`index.md`**: Ensure this file exists in the root directory and is correctly configured to use the `home` layout.
3. **`_layouts/home.html`**: Ensure this layout file exists and is correctly set up to display the homepage content.
4. **Posts**: Ensure there are posts in the `_posts` directory to display on the homepage.

### Example `index.md`:

Ensure your `index.md` file is correctly set up:

---
layout: home
